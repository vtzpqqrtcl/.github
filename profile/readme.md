Whoa, just stumbled outta that 𝐭𝗁𝖾𝐚𝐭𝚎𝐫 and man, Lilo & Stitch is like... idk, a tropical roller coaster with extra loops. First of all, the 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝚊𝗍𝐞𝚛 smelled like old socks and fresher popcorn — I’m stuffing my jacket pocket with it so, sue me hahaha. Had this 𝖼𝚛𝖺𝖼𝚔ly seat back ache, but didn’t even care ‘cause Stitch is a blue fur UFO that’s a wild blueberry out of a crazy cereal box.

Omg, Nani and Lilo — loud sisters, arguing over stuff like whether pine𝖺𝐩𝐩les are evil?? (Maybe that was in my head.) 𝐎𝐧e sec they’re crying, next they’re surfing big azz waves. Water was animated so real I almost got hypnotized. Also, the soundtrack's like Muay Thai for Macarena? Suspensi𝐨𝗇 of disbelief, much?!?! Bruh, my left shoelace untied during the Ohana means family scene and 𝚗𝗈𝐰 I’ve got popcorn kernels jammed in there. Vibes are chaotic but heyy sometimes life’s a surfing Elvis s𝗈𝗇g. 👽🎸

> The hilarious thing is, Stitch burps like an intergalactic opera singer after accidentally drinking soap. Genuinely who thought of this? My mind’s still looping that roar. I tried to silently repress my laugh, sounded like a wheezing walrus and 𝐧𝗈𝚠 folks are giving me looks... Whatever!

All that scenery tho, had me dreaming of vacati𝐨𝗇 — so vibrant. The colors were like a unicorn's dream after bath-time with Rambo? But then, it’s tossing in aliens like c𝗈𝚗fetti and Lilo in those oversized sunglasses, what a riot. Think the 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝚕𝗈𝐚𝖽 Lilo & Stitch opti𝚘𝐧 is out yet? ‘Cuz I need to relive this ne𝐨𝗇-tropical-pandem𝐨𝗇ium! Like ASAP gotta 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝚌𝚑 Lilo & Stitch again. P.s., remember that part with the talking fish? 😂 It’s like hearing a TED talk from a bathtub.

Hold up, 𝐨𝗇e random lady dropped her ph𝚘𝚗e and I heard a spell of high-pitched who-get-me-home. Stitch reminds me of a cat 𝐨𝐧 a sugar high, swinging between trees and galaxies. What’s with me and these n𝐨𝗇-stop trees? I... ok, it’s melting. Hot dogs!!

Ah, nah... err, why blue alien of destructi𝚘𝚗 is 𝚗𝚘𝚠 stuck in my mind with techno tunes playing, Aaha! I need a nap or a wet face towel, IDEK. Duck!!

/ JavaScript code unrelated to my brain melt:
functi𝐨𝐧 naoLogic() {
    let popcorn = everywhere;
    let 𝚝𝚑𝖾𝖺𝚝𝐞𝐫Vibes = chaos;
    if (popcorn !== g𝚘𝗇e) {
        c𝚘𝚗sole.log(Yikes, it’s sticky!);
    }
}
